# Topical-EHR

A research-focused [open-source](https://github.com/topical-ehr/topical-ehr) EHR prototype

## For research & innovation

* A test-bed for innovative ideas & emerging technologies - open-source means all parts of the system can be freely modified
* Not for clinical use - can start fresh & break things

## Aims

* Help multidisciplinary teams provide high-quality holistic care
* A focus on design & UX - it should be pleasant, efficient & easy to use


## Features under development

* **Topics** (e.g. Heart Disease) bring together a free-text summary with related diagnoses, prescriptions, tests, letters, etc - aiming to streamline complex histories and shared care
* **Timeline** column chronologically shows observations, test results & EMR changes
* **AI-assisted** summarisation & coding
* **Clinical Decision Support** helpers & alerts
* Other **UX** experiments - like auto-complete based prescription orders
* ...whatever **you** want to experiment with!

## Tech

* Web-application made using popular modern technologies (React, TypeScript)
* Architecture aims for easy customisation & extensibility
* Should be comfortable to build & develop on most laptops
* [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)-based
    * comes with [CandleLite](https://github.com/topical-ehr/candlelite), a new lightweight FHIR server written from the ground-up in [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
    * can run entirely inside a web browser for easy & cheap server-less deployments and isolation between users
    * could be made to "plug in" to existing systems
