# Topical-EHR

An [open-source](https://github.com/topical-ehr/topical-ehr) prototype of an research-focused EHR

## Designed for research & innovation

* A test-bed for innovative ideas
* Open-Source means everything can be modified
* Primarily focused on end-user UX - can be made to work with existing FHIR-based systems
* Not for clinical use - can start fresh & break things

## Features

* **Topics** (e.g. Heart Disease) bring together a free-text summary with related diagnoses, prescriptions, tests, letters, etc - aiming to streamline complex histories and shared care
* **Timeline** column chronologically shows observations, test results & EMR changes
* **AI-assisted** summarisation and coding
* **Clinical Decision Support** helpers & alerts
* Other **UX** experiments - like auto-complete based prescription orders
* ...whatever **you** want to experiment with!

## Tech

* Web-application made using popular modern technologies (React, TypeScript)
* Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
* FHIR-based
    * comes with [CandleLite](https://github.com/topical-ehr/candlelite), a new lightweight FHIR server written from the ground-up in F#
    * can run entirely inside a web browser using sqlite for easy & cheap server-less deployments and isolation between users
